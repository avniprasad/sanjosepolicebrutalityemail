<a href="mailto:ipa@sanjoseca.gov?bcc=mayoremail@sanjoseca.gov,city.clerk@sanjoseca.gov&subject=Accountability%20for%20Jared%20Yuen&body=Hi,
%0d%0dMy name is [insert name] and I am a resident of [City/State]. I am emailing today to demand accountability for the excessive violence displayed by the San Jose police officer Jared Yuen (badge #4362).
%0d%0dI demand that Jared Yuen be fired for displaying a gross abuse of power and endangering the lives of unarmed citizens. I understand that an investigation is being done, but video evidence showing his blatant disregard for the safety of the public is apparent. 
%0d%0dYuen handled the situation inappropriately and unprofessionally. He escalated the situation by using inappropriate language and proceeded to fire projectiles at the public. These projectiles when fired at close range are lethal. 
%0d%0dIn addition to Yuen's actions, I am disappointed in San Jose officials who are not holding Yuen responsible. Police Chief Eddie Garcia, for instance, said that Yuen is a good kid who made a mistake, while San Jose City Council member Lan Diep stated that Yuen should not be fired and that he should be given a “chance to atone”.  This rhetoric downplays the situation and is extremely dangerous especially when there are lives at stake. The lack of accountability of police officers is apparent and we are demanding justice for the victims of his brutality. I demand that Yuen, as well as other police officers who abuse their power, are held accountable for their actions.
%0d%0dSincerely,%0d[your name]" rel="EMAIL">Accountability for Jared Yuen</a>
